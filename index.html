<h4> DATABASE OBJECT </h4>
<h5>
        A database object in a relational database is a data structure
        used to either store or reference data.
        When a database object is created, a new object type cannot be created
        because all the various object types created are restricted by the very nature,
        or source code, of the relational database model being used, such as Oracle,
        SQL Server or Access. What is being created is instances of the objects, 
        such as a new table, an index on that table or a view on the same table. </h5>

<br/>

<h4>1. TABLE</h4>
<h5>A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database.
        It consists of columns, and rows.
        
        Object tables: store only objects In an object table, each row represents an object,
                   which is referred to as a row object.
        Relational tables: store objects with other table data Objects that are stored as
                     columns of a relational table, or are attributes of other objects,
                    are called column objects </h5>
<pre>   CREATE TABLE person_obj_table OF person_typ;

        INSERT INTO person_obj_table VALUES (
               person_typ(101, 'John', 'Smith') );
</pre>
  
<h5> can create a table called person_obj_table that is of type person_typ object on OBJECTS
  example so the table will have the id, firstname, lastname attributes.
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>2. OBJECT</h4>
<h5>An object type is a kind of data type. You can use it in the same ways that
        you use standard data types such as NUMBER or VARCHAR2. For example, you can
        specify an object type as the data type of a column in a relational table,
        and you can declare variables of an object type. The value is a variable or
        an instance of that type. An object instance is also called an object. you can
        also specify methods in it.</h5>
<pre>   CREATE TYPE person_typ AS OBJECT (
        idno           NUMBER,
        first_name     VARCHAR2(20),
        last_name      VARCHAR2(20),
        MAP MEMBER FUNCTION get_idno RETURN NUMBER
      )
      /
      CREATE TYPE BODY person_typ AS
        MAP MEMBER FUNCTION get_idno RETURN NUMBER IS
        BEGIN
          RETURN idno;
        END;
      END;
      /
</pre>
  
<h5> the above code creates object type instance called person_typ which has 
        id_number which takes type Number,
        first name which takes type Varchar up to 20 characters
        last_name which takes type Varchar up to 20 characters
        and at last there is a method called get_idno which returns id number with a type NUMBER
        so the method body is written below.
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>3. METHODS</h4>
<h5>Methods are procedures or functions that applications can use to perform operations on
        the attributes of the object type. Methods are optional. They define the behavior of 
        objects of that type.Object methods are functions or procedures that you can declare
        in an object type definition to implement behavior that you want objects of that type
        to perform.
        
        The general kinds of methods that can be declared in a type definition are:
        
        Member Methods
        Using member methods, you can provide access to the data of an object, and otherwise 
        define operations that an application performs on the data. To perform an operation, 
        the application calls the appropriate method on the appropriate object.
        
        Static Methods
        Static methods compare object instances and perform operations that do not use the data
        of any particular object, but, instead, are global to an object type.
        
        Constructor Methods
        A default constructor method is implicitly defined for every object type, unless it is 
        overwritten with a user-defined constructor. A constructor method is called on a type 
        to construct or create an object instance of the type.
        
        example</h5>

<pre>  /

CREATE TYPE BODY person_typ AS
  MAP MEMBER FUNCTION get_idno RETURN NUMBER IS
  BEGIN
    RETURN idno;
  END;
END;

/

</pre>
  
<h5>  in the above OBJECT example
        "MAP MEMBER FUNCTION get_idno RETURN NUMBER" first declares the function and the body
        is written above as follows
</h5>


<br/>

<h4>4. TRIGGER</h4>
<h5>Oracle allows defining procedures that are implicitly executed when an
        INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement is issued against the associated table. 
        These procedures are called database triggers.
        
        Triggers are similar to stored procedures, discussed in Chapter 14, "Procedures 
        and Packages". A trigger can include SQL and PL/SQL statements to execute as a unit
         and can invoke stored procedures. However, procedures and triggers differ in the way 
        that they are invoked. While a procedure is explicitly executed by a user, application, 
        or trigger, one or more triggers are implicitly fired (executed) by Oracle when 
        a triggering INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement is issued, no matter which user is
        connected or which application is being used. </h5>

<pre>  "AFTER UPDATE OF parts_on_hand ON inventory" this is a triggering statement
</pre>
  
<h5>which means that when the PARTS_ON_HAND column of a row in the INVENTORY table
        is updated, fire the trigger. Note that when the triggering event is an UPDATE
       statement, you can include a column list to identify which columns must be updated
       to fire the trigger. Because INSERT and DELETE statements affect entire rows
           of information, a column list cannot be specified for these options.
   
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>5. PACKAGES</h4>
<h5>Packages provide a method of encapsulating related procedures, functions, and associated
        cursors and variables together as a unit in the database. While packages allow the database administrator or application developer to organize
        similar routines, they also offer increased functionality and database performance. For example, </h5>
<pre>  CREATE PACKAGE bank_transactions  AS 
        minimum_balance  CONSTANT NUMBER := 100.00; 
        PROCEDURE apply_transactions; 
        PROCEDURE enter_transaction (acct   NUMBER, 
                      kind   CHAR, 
                      amount NUMBER); 
      END bank_transactions; 
      
      CREATE PACKAGE BODY bank_transactions AS  new_status  CHAR(20);
      PROCEDURE do_journal_entry (acct NUMBER, 
                      kind CHAR) IS
      
      BEGIN 
          INSERT INTO journal 
            VALUES (acct, kind, sysdate); 
          IF kind = 'D' THEN 
            new_status := 'Debit applied'; 
          ELSIF kind = 'C' THEN 
            new_status := 'Credit applied'; 
          ELSE 
            new_status := 'New account'; 
          END IF; 
        END do_journal_entry;
      .
      .
      .
      END bank_transactions;
</pre>
  
<h5> the above two statements create the specification and body for a package that contains
        several procedures that do the conditional checking if the journal is a kind of "C"
        or D or Other it manipulates based on those specific conditions and functions that
        process banking transactions. so stored packages also allow encapsulation.
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>6. INDEX</h4>
<h5>An index is a schema object that contains an entry for each value that appears in the
        indexed column(s) of the table or cluster and provides direct, fast access to rows. 
        Oracle Database supports several types of index:
        
        Normal indexes. (By default, Oracle Database creates B-tree indexes.)
        Bitmap indexes, which store rowids associated with a key value as a bitmap
        Partitioned indexes, which consist of partitions containing an entry for each
                     value that appears in the indexed column(s) of the table
        
        Function-based indexes, which are based on expressions. They enable you to construct
                        queries that evaluate the value returned by an expression, which
                    in turn may include built-in or user-defined functions.
        
        Domain indexes, which are instances of an application-specific index of type indextype </h5>

<pre>   "CREATE INDEX ord_customer_ix ON orders (customer_id);"
</pre>
  
<h5>The above statement creates an index on the customer_id column of the sample table
        orders:
        in the preceding statement, the customer_id column is the index key. The index itself
        is named ord_customer_ix.
</h5>



<br/>

<h4>7. CURSOR</h4>
<h5>A cursor is a pointer, which points towards a pre allocated memory location in the SGA.
        For transparent understanding, it is a handle or gateway adopted by Oracle to execute a
        SQL query. The memory location to which it points is known as Context area.
        Oracle associates every SELECT statement with a cursor to hold the query information in
        this context area.
        
        There are two types of cursors: Implicit cursors and explicit cursors.
        
        Implicit Cursors
        Oracle server processes every SQL statement in a PL/SQL block as an implicit cursor.
        All the DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) and SELECT query with INTO or BULK 
        COLLECT clauses are candidates for implicit cursors.
        
        Explicit Cursor
        These cursors are explicitly declared in the DECLARE section of the block. They possess
        a specific name and a static SELECT statement attached to them. Explicit cursors are
        manually executed by the developers and follow complete execution cycle.
        
        
        example: </h5>

<pre>   DECLARE
        CURSOR C_EMP IS
        SELECT EMPLOYEE_NAME, JOB_ID, SALARY
        FROM EMPLOYEES
        WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID=100;
        L_ENAME VARCHAR2(100);
        L_JOBID VARCHAR2(10);
        L_SALARY NUMBER;
        BEGIN
        OPEN C_EMP;
        FETCH C_EMP INTO L_ENAME, L_JOBID, L_SALARY;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(‘Employee ‘||L_ENAME||’ with Job function of
        ‘||L_JOBID||’ draws ‘||TO_CHAR(L_SALARY)||’ per month’);
        CLOSE C_EMP;
</pre>
  
<h5> in the above code declares a cursor, which select employee name, job id and salary for 
        the employees with employee id 100. Note the opening, fetching and closing of the 
        cursor. Here cursor returns a single record.
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>8. VIEW</h4>
<h5>Views are virtual tables formed by a query. A view is a dictionary 
        object that you can use until you drop it. Views are not updatable.
        which is a logical table based on one or more tables or views. A view contains no data
        itself. The tables upon which a view is based are called base tables.
         </h5>
<pre>  CREATE VIEW SAMP.V1 (COL_SUM, COL_DIFF)
        AS SELECT COMM + BONUS, COMM - BONUS
        FROM SAMP.EMPLOYEE;
</pre>
  
<h5>creates a view for the inherited columns COL_SUM and COL_DIFF
        then selects the sum and diffrence of bonus form the employee.
        
</h5>


<br/>

<h4>9. RECORD</h4>
<h5>A record is a composite datatype. which means that it can hold more than one piece of 
        information. as compared to a scalar datatype such as number or string. </h5>
<pre>   CREATE PROCEDUER process_employee(
        employee_id_in IN
        omag_employees.employee_id%TYPE
    )
    IS
    l_employee  omag_employees%ROWTYPE;
    BEGIN
        SELECT employee_id,
               lastname,
               salary
        INTO l_employee
        FROM omag_employee
        WHERE employee_id = employee_id_in;
    END;
    
</pre>
  
<h5> when the above procedure is compiled, SQL/PL looks up the structure of the omag_employees
        table and defines a record that has a field for each column in the table, with the same name
        and datatype. By using %ROWTYPE to declare the record, 
</h5>


<br/>

<h4>10. SEQUENCE</h4>
<h5>Sequences are special database objects that provide numbers in sequence for input to
        a table. They are useful for providing generated primary key values and for input of 
        number type columns such as purchase order, employee number, sample number, and sales 
        order number, where the input must be unique and in some form of numerical sequence.
        
        The owner of the schema where the sequence generator lives automatically gains the USAGE
        privilege on the sequence generator, and can grant this privilege to other users and 
        roles. Only the database owner and the owner of the sequence generator can grant these 
        USAGE privileges. The USAGE privilege cannot be revoked from the schema owner.</h5>
<pre>  CREATE SEQUENCE order_entry_id
        AS BIGINT
        START WITH 3000000000;
</pre>
  
<h5>The above statement creates a sequence of type BIGINT with a start value of 3,000,000,000
        .The value increases by 1, and the last legal value is the largest possible BIGINT. 
        If NEXT VALUE FOR is invoked on the generator again, Derby throws an exception.
        
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>11. FUNCTION</h4>
<h5>A stored function is a special kind stored program that returns a single value. You use stored functions to encapsulate common formulas or business rules that are reusable among SQL statements or stored programs.</h5>
<pre>  DELIMITER $$
                                
        CREATE FUNCTION CustomerLevel(p_creditLimit double) RETURNS VARCHAR(10)
            DETERMINISTIC
        BEGIN
            DECLARE lvl varchar(10);
            
            IF p_creditLimit > 50000 THEN
            SET lvl = 'PLATINUM';
            ELSEIF (p_creditLimit <= 50000 AND p_creditLimit >= 10000) THEN
                SET lvl = 'GOLD';
            ELSEIF p_creditLimit < 10000 THEN
                SET lvl = 'SILVER';
            END IF;
            
            RETURN (lvl);
        END
        
Now we can use:
            
        SELECT 
            customerName, 
            CustomerLevel(creditLimit)
        FROM
            customers
        ORDER BY 
            customerName;
</pre>
  
<h5>The above function will determine customer level depending on their credit limit
        
</h5>

<br/>

<h4>12. CONSTRAINT</h4>
<h5>Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database. Constraints could be either on a column level or a table level. The column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas the table level constraints are applied to the whole table.</h5>
<pre>  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
        newauthor(aut_id varchar(8) NOT NULL , 
        aut_name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
        country varchar(25) NOT NULL CHECK (country IN ('USA','UK','India')), 
        home_city varchar(25) NOT NULL, 
        PRIMARY KEY (aut_id,home_city));
</pre>
  
<h5>In the above table auth_id cant be left open for any given row and auth_id and home_city cant be Similar for two rows. country value can be USA or UK or India.
        
</h5>



<br/>

<h4>13. DATABASELINK</h4>
<h5>In oracle database, a database link is a schema object in one database that enables you to access objects on another database. The other database need not be an Oracle Database system. However, to access non-Oracle systems you must use Oracle Heterogeneous Services.</h5>
<pre>  CREATE DATABASE LINK remote.us.oracle.com
        CONNECT TO CURRENT_USER
        USING 'remote';
</pre>
  
<h5>
    in the above example the Link gives or enables access to the remote.us.oracle.com database 
</h5>
